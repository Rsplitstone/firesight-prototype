# FireSight Prototype

This repository contains prototype interfaces for the FireSight AI dashboard. Two HTML files are included:

- `index.html` – the original static prototype with a sidebar and alert interactions.
- `dashboard.html` – a simplified React demo that shows a live alerts feed, an interactive map, sample charts and a prediction panel.

To try the React demo, open `dashboard.html` in a web browser. It loads React, Leaflet and Chart.js from public CDNs so no build step is required.
